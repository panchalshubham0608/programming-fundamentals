Goal: Students should know how to convert a digit to an integer effectively.

Write a program to input a character. If the character is a digit then print the number obtained by multiplying 3 to the digit, otherwise print `Not a digit`.

```c++
Enter a character: 7
7 * 3 = 21
```c++

```c++
Enter a character: #
Not a digit
```
