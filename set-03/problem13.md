Goal: Student should know how to check for leap year.

Write a program to input a number and print `Leap Year` if the number represents a leap year, otherwise print `Not Leap Year`.  
Note: A year is a leap year if either is divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 but not by 100.

```c++
Enter a number: 2000
Leap Year
```

```c++
Enter a number: 1900
Not Leap Year
```

```c++
Enter a number: 2028
Leap Year
```
