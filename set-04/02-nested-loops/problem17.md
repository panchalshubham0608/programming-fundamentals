Goal: Student should know how to use nested double loops.  

The taylor series for the consine function $cos(x)$ is given as follows:  
$cos(x) = 1 - \dfrac{x^2}{2!} + \dfrac{x^4}{4!} - \dfrac{x^6}{6!} + ... $  

Write a program to input two integers $x$ and $N$ and find the sum of first $N$ terms of the sequence given $x$.  

NOTE: **DO NOT** use any built-in function such as `pow(x, y)`. You are only allowed to use nested loops.  

```
Enter the value of x: 2
Enter the value of N: 4
-0.422222
```
Explanation: $1 - \dfrac{2^2}{2!} + \dfrac{2^4}{4!} - \dfrac{2^6}{6!} = 1 - 2 + 0.666666 - 0.088888 = -0.422222$
