Goal: Student should know how to use nested double loops.  

The taylor series for the exponent function $e^x$ is given as follows:  
$e^x = 1 + \dfrac{x}{1!} + \dfrac{x^2}{2!} + \dfrac{x^3}{3!} + \dfrac{x^4}{4!} + ... $  

Write a program to input two integers $x$ and $N$ and find the sum of first $N$ terms of the sequence given $x$.  

NOTE: **DO NOT** use any built-in function such as `pow(x, y)`. You are only allowed to use nested loops.  

```
Enter the value of x: 2
Enter the value of N: 4
6.333333
```
Explanation: $1 + \dfrac{2}{1!} + \dfrac{2^2}{2!} + \dfrac{2^3}{3!} = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1.333333 = 6.333333$
