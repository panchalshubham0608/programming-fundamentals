Goal: Student should know how to use nested double loops.  

Write a program to input an integer $N$ and print a $N$ x $N$ matrix as shown below:  

```
(0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3)
(1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3)
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) (2, 3)
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) (3, 4)
```


```
Enter a number: 3
(0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2)
(1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2)
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3)
```
