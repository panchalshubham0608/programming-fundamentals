Goal: Student should know how to use nested multiple loops.  

Write a program to find the sum of the first $N$ terms of the following series.  
$(1^1) + (1^2+2^2) + (1^3+2^3+3^3) + (1^4+2^4+3^4+4^4) + .... $ 

NOTE: You are **NOT** allowed to use built-in functions such as `pow(x, y)`; only use nested loops. 

```
Enter a number: 3
42
```  
Explanation: $(1^1) + (1^2+2^2) + (1^3+2^3+3^3) = 1 + 5 + 36 = 42$
