Goal: Student should know basic problems involving single loop.

Write a program to print first N terms of a `Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...`  

You may find the following relations helpful:  
$f(1) = 0$  
$f(2) = 1$  
$f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n-2) \forall n > 2$   


```
Enter a number: 8
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
```
