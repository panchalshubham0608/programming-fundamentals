Goal: Student should know common problems involving single loop.  

Write a program to input an integer $N$ and print `Palindrome` if $N$ is palindrome; otherwise print `Not Palindrome`.   
Assumption: $N \ge 0$  
Note that a number $N$ is palindrome if the number obtained by reversing the digits is same as the original number

```
Enter a number: 121
Palindrome
```

```
Enter a number: 122
Not Palindrome
```

**Follow up:** Can you solve the same problem when $N$ could be negative?
