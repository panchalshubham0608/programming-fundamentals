Goal: Student should know logic building with arrays.  

Write a program to count the number of elements smaller than the current element on the left side of the current element.   


**Input format:**  
The first line of input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.  
The second line of input contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.  

**Output format:**  
Print the length of the longest chain in array.

**Example**
```
5
1 3 2 5 4
0 1 1 3 3
```

Number of elements smaller than and left to 1: 0  
Number of elements smaller than and left to 3: 1 (1)  
Number of elements smaller than and left to 2: 1 (1)  
Number of elements smaller than and left to 5: 3 (1, 2, 3)  
Number of elements smaller than and left to 4: 3 (1, 2, 3)
