Goal: Student should know logic building with arrays.  

Write a program to count the number of good pairs in array.   
A pair of indices `(i, j)` is said to be a good pair if `arr[i] = arr[j]; i < j`  

**Input format:**  
The first line of input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.  
The second line of input contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.  


**Output format:**  
A single line of output containing the number of good pairs in the array.  

**Example**
```
6
1 2 3 1 1 3
4
```
There are four good pairs `(0, 3), (0, 4), (3, 4), (2, 5)`
