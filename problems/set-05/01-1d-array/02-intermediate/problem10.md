Goal: Student should know logic building with arrays.  

Given two `sorted` arrays. Write a  program to merge these two arrays into another `sorted` array.

**Input format:**  
The first line of input contains two space integer N1 and N2 denoting the number of elements in first and second array respectively.  
The second line of input contains N1 space separated integers denoting the elements of the first array.
The third line of input contains N2 space separated integers denoting the elements of the second array.  

**Output format:**  
Print the newly constructed array.  

**Example**
```
3 4
1 4 2
2 3 4 5
1 2 2 3 4 4 5
```
