Goal: Student should know logic building with arrays.  

Given two `sorted` arrays where first array is sorted in ascending order and second array is sorted in descending order. Write a  program to merge these two arrays into another `sorted` array sorted in ascending order.

**Input format:**  
The first line of input contains two space integer N1 and N2 denoting the number of elements in first and second array respectively.  
The second line of input contains N1 space separated integers denoting the elements of the first array.
The third line of input contains N2 space separated integers denoting the elements of the second array.  

**Output format:**  
Print the newly constructed array.  

**Example**
```
3 4
1 2 4
5 4 3 2
1 2 2 3 4 4 5
```
Given arr1= [1, 4, 2] and arr2=[5, 4, 3, 2].   
The array obtained by merging elements of arr1 and arr2 in ascending order is [1,2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
