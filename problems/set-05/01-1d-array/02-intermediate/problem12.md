Goal: Student should know logic building with arrays.  

Given two arrays of size `N1` and `N2` denoting two numbers. Write a program to create a new array of which contains the sum of these two numbers. 

**Input format:**  
The first line of input contains two space integer N1 and N2 denoting the number of elements in first and second array respectively.  
The second line of input contains N1 space separated integers denoting the elements of the first array.
The third line of input contains N2 space separated integers denoting the elements of the second array.  

**Output format:**  
Print the newly constructed array.  

**Example**
```
3 3
1 2 3
1 2 4
2 4 7
```
The array represents the number 123 and the second array represents the number 124. Adding these two numbers we get 247.  

```
3 4
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 3 5 7
```   
The first array represents the number 123 and the second array represents teh number 1234. Adding these two numbers we get, 123 + 1234 = 1357

```
2 3
1 2
7 8
9 0
```  
The first array represents the number 12 and the second array represents the number 78. Adding these two numbers we get, 12 + 78 = 90  

```
2 3
9 9
9 9 9
1 0 9 8
```
The first array represents the number 99 and the second array represents the number 999. Adding these two numbers we get, 99 + 999 = 1098
