Goal: Student should know how to find frequency of an element in array based on a condition. 

Write a program to input `N` integers from user and output the number of elements in the array that has the property `arr[i] = i`


**Input Format**:  
The first line of input contains a single integer N  
The second line of input contains N space separated integers.  

**NOTE**: The array elements are zero-based indexed.  
|Index|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Element|5|1|1|3|2|5|0|8|8|6|


```

```  
There are four elements with property `arr[i] = i`   
arr[1] = 1  
arr[3] = 3  
arr[5] = 5  
arr[8] = 8
