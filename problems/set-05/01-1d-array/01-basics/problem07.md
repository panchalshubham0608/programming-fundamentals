Goal: Student should know how to iterate through array in reverse direction.

Write a program to input `N` integers from user output the elements in reverse order.  

**Input Format**:  
The first line of input contains a single integer N  
The second line of input contains N space separated integers.  


```cpp
10
5 8 1 9 2 3 0 8 4 6
The elements in reverse order are:  
6 4 8 0 3 2 9 1 8 5
```
