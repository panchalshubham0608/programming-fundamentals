Goal: Student should know how to find second maximum in an array.  

Write a program to input `N` integers from user output the second maximum element.  
**Input Format**:  
The first line of input contains a single integer N  
The second line of input contains N space separated integers.  

**NOTE**:  
- It is guaranteed that the second maximum element exist in the array.  
- _The second maximum element is the element that comes at second position when we arrange the items in descending order_.

```cpp
10
5 8 1 9 2 3 0 8 4 6
The second maximum element is 8
```

```cpp
10
5 8 1 9 2 3 0 9 4 6
The second maximum element is 9
```
_Explanation_:   
Arrange items in decreasing order: 9 9 8 6 5 4 0 3 2 1  
The second element is 9 and hence second maximum is 9
