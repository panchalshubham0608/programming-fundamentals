Goal: Student should know how to check if an array is palindrome.  

Write a program to input `N` integers from user and output `true` if the array is palindrome; `false` otherwise.   
An array is considered as palindrome if the array obtained by reversing the elements is same as the original array.  


**Input Format**:  
The first line of input contains a single integer N  
The second line of input contains N space separated integers.  

**NOTE**: The array elements are zero-based indexed.  
|Index|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Element|1|2|3|4|5|5|4|3|2|1|


```
10
1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1
true
```  

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
false
```
