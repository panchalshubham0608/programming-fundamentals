Goal: Student should know how to perform element-wise sum of two arrays.  

Write a program to input two arrays of size `N` and print the array obtained by sum of the two arrays.   


**Input Format**:  
The first line of input contains a single integer N  
The second line of input contains N space separated integers denoting elements in first array.  
The third line of input contains N space separated integers denoting elements in the second array.  

**NOTE**: The array elements are zero-based indexed.  
|Index|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Element|1|2|3|4|5|5|4|3|2|1|


```
5
1 2 3 4 5
0 3 5 2 6
1 5 8 6 11
```  
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
arr2 = [0, 3, 5, 2, 6]  
Element-wise sum:= arr1 + arr2 = [1, 5, 8, 6, 11]
