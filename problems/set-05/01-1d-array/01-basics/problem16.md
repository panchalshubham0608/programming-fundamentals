Goal: Student should know how to find frequency of an element in array based on a condition. 

Write a program to input `N` integers from user and output the number of elements in the array that lies in range `[1, 5]`


**Input Format**:  
The first line of input contains a single integer N  
The second line of input contains N space separated integers.  

**NOTE**: The array elements are zero-based indexed.  
|Index|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Element|5|8|1|9|2|3|0|8|4|6|


```
10
5 8 1 9 2 3 0 8 4 6
Number of elements in range [1, 5] are 5
```  

```
10
5 8 1 1 2 3 0 5 4 6
Number of elements in range [1, 5] are 7
```
