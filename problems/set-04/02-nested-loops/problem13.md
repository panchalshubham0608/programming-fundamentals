Goal: Student should know how to use nested multiple loops.  

Write a program to print the following table:  
```
0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 1  
0 0 1 0  
0 0 1 1  
0 1 0 0  
0 1 0 1  
0 1 1 0  
0 1 1 1  
1 0 0 0  
1 0 0 1  
1 0 1 0  
1 0 1 1  
1 1 0 0  
1 1 0 1  
1 1 1 0  
1 1 1 1  
```

NOTE: You are expected to use multiple nested for loops to achieve this!
