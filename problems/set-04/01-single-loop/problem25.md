Goal: Student should know common problems involving single loop.  

Write a program to input a `three-digit` number $N$ and print `Armstrong` if the number $N$ is armstrong; otherwise print `Not Armstrong`.  
Assumption: $N \ge 0$  

A number is armstrong if the sum of digits raised to the power number of digits is equal to the original number.  

```
Enter a number: 153
Armstrong
```
Explanation: $1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 = 153$ (original number)  

```
Enter a number: 123
Not Armstrong
```
Explanation: $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36 \ne 123$(original number)
