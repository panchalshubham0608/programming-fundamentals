Goal: Student should know common problems involving single loop.  

Write a program to input an integer $N$ and print the number of digits in $N$.  
Assumption: $N \ge 0$  

```
Enter a number: 1211
Number 1211 has 4 digits.
```

**Follow up:** Can you solve the same problem when $N$ could be negative?
