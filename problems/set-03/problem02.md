Goal: Student should know that if-statement can be used standalone

Write a program to input an integer and `Greater than 10` if the number is greater than 10. No output should be generated when the number is smaller than or equal to 10.

```c++
Enter a number: 20
Greater than 10
```

```c++
Enter a number: 9
```
