Goal: Student should know how to convert lower-case characters to upper-case and vice-versa based on ASCII values.

Write a program to input a character. If the character represents a lowercase alphabet then print its uppercase representation or vice-versa. If it does not represent a character then print `Not an alphabet`

```c++
Enter a character: w
Uppercase representation of w is W
```

```c++
Enter a character: G
Lowercase representation of G is g
```

```c++
Enter a character: %
Not an alphabet
```
